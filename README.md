#chatterbox-server
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

To Setup:

Run:

npm install

npm test  - to run the tests from the main directory

nodemon - to start the server

Make sure you client is working (all dependencies installed like jquery)
